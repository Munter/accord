# CJSX

Transforms jsx syntax in coffeescript files into valid coffeescript. Does not transform all the way down to javascript, you must also compile the resulting coffeescript code after this if you are targeting js.

Does not accept any options, and does not geneerate sourcemaps, although that feature is currently in progress according to the author at time of writing.

## Supported Methods
